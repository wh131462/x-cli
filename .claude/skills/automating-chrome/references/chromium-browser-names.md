# Chromium browser name mapping

Use these names in `Application("...")` and Script Editor dictionaries.

```
Google Chrome         -> "Google Chrome"
Brave                 -> "Brave Browser"
Microsoft Edge        -> "Microsoft Edge"
Arc                   -> "Arc"
Vivaldi               -> "Vivaldi"
Chromium              -> "Chromium"
```

Notes:

- Verify the exact name in /Applications and Script Editor.
- Some browsers require their own "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" setting or equivalent.
